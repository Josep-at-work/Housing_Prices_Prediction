This Notebook is the result of the new concepts I've learnt in the [introductory](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) and [intermediate](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning) ML micro-courses on Kaggle. 

## Key concepts:
+ List/Dict comprehension.
+ Imputation of missing values with `SimpleImputer()` method from sklearn.
+ One-Hot Encoding of categorical variables with `OneHotEncoder` class of sklearn.
+ Ensemble the preprocessing concepts with `ColumTransformer` from sklearn.
+ Use Cross-Validation on the hyperparameter searching step. 
+ Optimized a XGBoost Regression model for the prediction of sale prices. Used the implementation of the scikit-learn API.
+ With the `Pipeline` class from sklearn I've ensambled the preprocessing steps with the model.
